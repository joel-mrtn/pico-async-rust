# pico-async-rust

This project is based on tutorials from [The Rusty Bits](https://www.youtube.com/@therustybits/videos). In his videos, he uses a micro:bit V2, but I adapted the code for the Raspberry Pi Pico and added some improvements. Since the Pico doesnâ€™t have a built-in LED grid with buttons like the micro:bit, I built one myself.
